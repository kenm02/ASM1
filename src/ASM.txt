Task 1:Print out to screen 20 first numbers of Fibonacci order by descending. (1 point)

Task 2: Create a function, input is a hexadecimal string, the size of this string must be 4 bytes. Convert this string
to binary string. Turn-off the bit 3 of byte 2 to 0. The result of function is a hexadecimal string after turn-off B2b3.
The function could be extension function or normal function ( 3 points )
Example:
valresult = turnOffB2b3(“12345678”)
println(result)// result is “12305678”

Task 3:Write a program to find all numbers divisible by 7 but not multiples of 5, between 10 and 200 (counting 10 and 200).
 The resulting numbers will be printed as strings on a line, separated by commas. ( 1 point )

Task 4:Write a program that input a two-digit integer number. Convert and printout the value of inputted number
in binary and hexadecimal. ( 1 point )

Task 5:Enter an array of integer numbers a0, a1, a2, ..., an-1. Do not use any other array, print the above
 array screen in ascending order. (1 point )

Task 6:Enter an string. Count the number of words in the string. Capitalize the first letter of the word
 if it begins for a sentence. ( 1 point )

Task 7:Write a program input month and year, print out the number of days that month. ( 2 point )

Task8:Create a program( 3 points)
1. Input a primary account numbers (PAN) of a ATM card. Length of PAN is from 12-19 digits. PAN only allow numeric characters.
2. Validate the entered PAN using Luhn algorithm.
(Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithmor https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thuật_toán_Luhn)
3. Print out to screen the card type of entered PAN.
Know that:
PAN is start by             CardType
4                    |       VISA Card
-------------------------------------------
50..69,2221..2720    |      Master Card
-------------------------------------------
3528..3589           |      JCB Card
-------------------------------------------
Other                |      Unknown Card

Task 9: Write a simple application in order to solve the degree equation. ( 2 points )


Task 10: Write a program to simulate the Banking ATM which has the following features: ( 4 points )
   1. Sign in.
   2. Withdraw money.
   3. Check remaining amount of money.
   4. Exit.
For more details
   [*] Details:

   - Step 1: Ask user to insert his ATM card and press Enter to continue.

   - Step 2: Ask user to enter password:
	 + If password length is less than 6 characters, print out an error to user (Invalid password).
	 + Otherwise, print out the total money that user has (4.000.000 VND).
	 + If user continuously types wrong passwords for 3 times, then blocking the account and printing an error to user.

   - Step 3: Print out possible options for user:
	 + Withdraw money.
	 + Check remaining amount of money.
	 + Exit.

   * Details of transactions:
	 - Withdraw:
	   + Ask user to enter the amount of money that he expects to get.
	   + Check all possible cases.
	   + If no problem:
		 Print out a message to indicate successful transaction.
		 Print out a message to force user to get back the card and his money and press Enter to continue.
		 Ask user whether he would like to do another transaction.
		 	[.] If yes, go back to Step 3.
		[.] Otherwise, print out a message to say thanks to user, then exiting the program.
